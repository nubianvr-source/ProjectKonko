  _info: "What does a resistor do?\r\n"
  _answers:
  - _info: A resistor allows current to flow in one direction
    _isCorrect: 0
    _interventionText: 'No, a resistor limits the flow of current '
  - _info: A resistor limits / controls / reduces the current that flows in a circuit
    _isCorrect: 1
    _interventionText: Yes a resistor controls or limits current flow within a circuit
  - _info: A resistor holds the electromotive force in a circuit
    _isCorrect: 0
    _interventionText: An EMF and a resistor are two different electric components
  - _info: A resistor prevents too much current from flowing in a circuit
    _isCorrect: 1
    _interventionText: Controlling the current within the circuit helps protect the
      electric devices connected to it.
  - _info: A resistor produces the electrical current needed to flow in a circuit
    _isCorrect: 0
    _interventionText: 'No, a resistor does not produce electric current '
