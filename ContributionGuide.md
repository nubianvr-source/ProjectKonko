# Introduction

### Thanks for coming around!

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to Basic Electronics tutoring in VR. It's people like you that make Project Konko  such a great tool.

[source: [Nubian VR](https://github.com/nubianvr-source/ProjectKonko)] 

### Why the guidelines

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What kinds of contributions are we looking for?

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug tracking, or writing tutorials, extending functionality are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

> NubianVR Learning Environment is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from modifying code to writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into newer features.

### What contributions are we NOT looking for?

> Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions]. A better community forum will be set up and communicated publicly. Stack Overflow is also worth considering.


# Ground Rules
This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc).

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure that code that goes into core meets passes the tests and new code has tests backing it. 
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably 3 new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. 


# Your First Contribution

> Unsure where to begin contributing to NubianVR? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, the number of comments is a reasonable proxy for the impact a given change will have.

### Bonus points: link to a resource for people who have never contributed to open source before.
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub]

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
>
>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
### Developer Certificate of Origin
Please note that as a contributor you will need to agree to a DCO in order for us to know that the intellectual property you are submitting is in fact your own.

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
 


> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a DCO.
>
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email info@nubianvr.com instead.
> Any security issues should be submitted directly to  info@nubianvr.com
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at  info@nubianvr.com


### How to file a bug report.
> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Unity are you using?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### If you have a particular roadmap, goals, or philosophy for development, share it here.
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.



### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.


# Code review process
### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly meeting that we hold. Notes are posted to the Nubian VR Community Development channel on the Discord server here: https://discord.gg/nVPEcuY
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.


# Community

> You can chat with the core team in the chat-with-nubian channel on the Discord server here https://discord.gg/nVPEcuY. We try to have office hours on Fridays.
